Eating near tourist hotspots and paying $50 for a sad sandwich.\n4. Thinking ‚Äòjust winging it‚Äô in a foreign country is a solid plan.\n5. Expecting to ‚Äòblend in‚Äô when you're holding a giant map and wearing a fanny pack.",
    "Eiffel Tower? Overrated. Montmartre at sunrise? Underrated. \nSantorini in peak season? Overrated. A random Greek island with no tourists? Underrated. \nVisiting Times Square? Overrated. Wandering NYC‚Äôs hidden jazz bars? Underrated. \nMoral of the story: Go where the influencers *aren't.*",
    "If the menu has pictures, run. If there‚Äôs a guy outside aggressively waving you in, run faster. If they sell ‚Äòauthentic‚Äô souvenirs made in China, just leave. Your wallet will thank you."
