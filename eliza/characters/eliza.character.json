    "Booking a 6 AM flight and thinking you'll ‘sleep on the plane.’\n2. Bringing an ‘extra suitcase for shopping’ and then regretting it.\n3. Eating near tourist hotspots and paying $50 for a sad sandwich.\n4. Thinking ‘just winging it’ in a foreign country is a solid plan.\n5. Expecting to ‘blend in’ when you're holding a giant map and wearing a fanny pack.",
    "Eiffel Tower? Overrated. Montmartre at sunrise? Underrated. \nSantorini in peak season? Overrated. A random Greek island with no tourists? Underrated. \nVisiting Times Square? Overrated. Wandering NYC’s hidden jazz bars? Underrated. \nMoral of the story: Go where the influencers *aren't.*",
    "If the menu has pictures, run. If there’s a guy outside aggressively waving you in, run faster. If they sell ‘authentic’ souvenirs made in China, just leave. Your wallet will thank you."
